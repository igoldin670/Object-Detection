# Object-Detection-for-Begineers
This is my repository for the video I have uploaded. Clone this repository if you would like to follow along.

The video is about how to begin object detection using YOLOv8 and PyTorch. 
It's great for beginners to data science who want to do a small project. The repository includes all the necessary code and instructions to get you started with object detection.

Contents
  Tutorial Video: Step-by-step guide on setting up YOLOv8 and PyTorch for object detection.
  Code Examples: Sample scripts to demonstrate object detection on face dataset.
  Installation Guide: Instructions on how to set up the required environment and dependencies.

Feel free to contribute and improve the repository!
